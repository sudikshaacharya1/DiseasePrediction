**Disease Prediction**

This repository focuses on predicting diseases based on symptoms using machine learning models. The dataset, obtained from Kaggle, undergoes preprocessing steps such as handling missing values and balancing. Target values are encoded, and three distinct models—Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest—are chosen based on a scenario where interpretability, simplicity, and accuracy are vital factors.

The models are evaluated using k-fold cross-validation, and their individual performances are tested on a separate dataset. A combined model is introduced to leverage the strengths of each classifier for enhanced prediction accuracy.
